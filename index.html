    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>We are Lavender Labs: A group of high school developers honing our CS skills by making diverse projects. As childhood friends, it’s our mission to improve as a team and achieve our goal of developing innovative games. We met in 2018 while playing video games with mutual friends (and still do our Friday game nights!) Even early on, our individual passions for programming were obvious; but as a team, we’ve helped and inspired each other to improve far beyond our capabilities alone. Currently, the team is focused on building our foundation by working on projects and improving our skill sets. We hope you enjoy browsing through our projects from throughout the years!</p>

      <p>Hi, I’m Melinda Yu, a senior at TEC Connections Academy. Growing up, I’ve always been fascinated by programming and video games. My main passion is psychology — but I also write, fence, and play video games with friends in my free time! I have been teaching programming (mainly Processing and Java) since I was 13 and Introduction to Psychology more recently. My main role on the team is management and web design!</p>

      <p>Hi! I'm Max Raffel, currently a senior at Newton South High School, and I love everything programming. I taught myself how to code in middle school, and have been making whatever crosses my mind ever since! I'm most well-versed in web development, but I also have developed with the Unity game engine, Node.js, the .NET framework, Swift, and python. When I'm not coding I like to practice kung fu, read, and play videogames with my friends! At Lavender, I typically do full-stack work!</p>

      <p>Hey, I'm Eric Shen, a current senior at Newton South High School. My hobbies are swimming, video games, and hiking. I've been swimming since I was 6 for my local town team and an active Boy Scout for nearly 7 years. I love coding because it incorporates elements of creativity (like website and GUI design) and problem-solving through code optimization and algorithms. I've programming for 7 years total and hope to spend many more. My prior projects consist of creating video games, designing websites, benchmarking code, constructing VMs, developing applications, etc. My main coding languages consist of Java, Swift, Processing, and Python, and I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main role is back-end developer, but I've occasionally worked as front-end.</p>

      <p>Hi, I'm Connor Huang, a senior at Newton South High School with a passion for chemistry and computer science. Since I was 8, I've tried many different areas of programming, and used my knowledge to make anything from silly websites to programming a digital chess game. I love using coding to express my creativity. Aside from programming, I love fencing, cooking, and playing video games with my friends.</p>
